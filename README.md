Hi iVuDang here! 

Let’s get started with GitHub!

Learn how to:
1. Create a new respository
2. Create a branch
3. Make and commit changes
4. Open and review a pull request
5. Merge pull request into respository

The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

1.	Create a branch: Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually main) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.

2.	Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.

3.	Open a pull request: Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.

4.	Discuss and review code: Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.

5.	Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.

6.	Deploy: Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
